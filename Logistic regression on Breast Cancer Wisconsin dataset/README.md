## Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset

This dataset can be downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29

Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

1) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3) perimeter
4) area
5) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9) symmetry
10) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
